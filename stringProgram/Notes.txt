String is a final predefined class.
String objects are used to store sequence of character.

Since String is a final class we will not be able to extend any class to this 
string class

String literals create objects in SCP(String Constant Pool). It provides 
memory management.

When we store data in string object, each character is given in index starting 
from 0 to length()-1.

String is a class so it has many methods in it. Most commonly used methods are:-

1) length() - this method will give you the total number of character in String

2) s.charAt(index) - this method will get the character present at the given index

3) .toLowerCase() - this method returns a new String object in which all letters
					are in small.
					
4) .toUpperCase() - this method returns a new String object in which all letters
					are in capital.
					
5) .contains() - this method returns true if it finds the given word in our String
				 otherwise it return false.
				 
6) .replace(oldCharacter, newCharacter) - this method returns a new String in
										  which all old character is replaced
										  by new character. 				 
				 
7) .replace("String1", "String2") - this method returns a new String in which all
									old String1 is replaced by new String2.			 
				 
8) .replaceFirst("String1", "String2") - this method returns a new String in where
 										 only the first occurance of the word
 										 String1 is replaced by new String2.					 
				 
9) .indexOf('character') - this method returns the index of the first occurance
						   of the given character

10) .lastIndexOf('character') - this method returns the index of the last 
								occurance of the given character

11) .indexOf("String") - this method returns the index of the first occurance
						of the given String


12) .indexOf('character', startIndex) - this method returns the index of the first 
									  	occurance of the given character starting 
									 	the search from given startIndex

13) .indexOf("String", startIndex) - this method returns the index of the first 
									 occurance of the given string starting the
									 search from given startIndex

14) .substring() - this method returns a new String in which there are all 
				   characters of the original string starting from the given index

15) .substring(startIndex, offSetIndex) - this method returns a new String in 
										  which there are all characters of the 
										  original string starting from the given 
										  startIndex upto the offSetIndex.
				   						  Note: We will not see the character 
				   						  present in the offSetIndex.
				   						  
16) .startsWith(word) - will give true if the string starts with the given word

17) .endsWith(word) - will give true if the string ends with the given word

18) concat() - will create a new object with all the new character to original
			   value


String is immutable; its original object cannot be changed, if we call any methods
to change the value then a new object is created.
